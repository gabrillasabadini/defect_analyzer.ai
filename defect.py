proper bullet points in more precise way ( maximum 3 lines ) and answer for the following questions:

1. Is there is any structural defects such as cracks, bends, damage in the given image and give the probability?
2. What is the severity level of the defect like minor, moderate or major defcts
3. What is the possible cause for the given defect, considering the material damage, environmental damage
4. Under what condition the defect shown will propage further in future?
5. Say whether we can repair this defect or not? If not say whether we need to replace this or not?
6. Suggest the remedies to repair the defect caused including materials used to repair the defect.
7. Say whether the defect shown with affect the surroungings and give probability for that.
8. Say whether we need to monitor the defected area after repair or replacements.
9. Dose the observed defect has any dependency on indusries.
10. What are the possibilities for teh defects to happen again?
